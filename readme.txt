Pretty much all of the features of our project we were aiming to have been completed to be functional. Some minor touches could be added in the future, such as aesthetic changes and possibly more intuitive UI. 

Also, the async task with fetching receipt values blocks the main thread while the api call is running, which will cause a black screen for 10-15 seconds. We hoped to make this more smooth, but given the time restraints and design of our project it was hard to find a way around this.

We also decided to use a website called RoboHash to generate creatures rather than drawing our own parts, just for times sake since it would allow us to focus on the functionality of the app.

We also were thinking about adding stuff like a creceipture's birth place (where the receipt was from), but we didn't think it was important enough to include for this deadline. However, our code is modular enough where adding things like that would scale easily.
